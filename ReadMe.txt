Part A: Numerical Differentiation Under Noise
This project investigates the numerical differentiation of a noisy sinusoidal signal using three finite-difference schemes — forward, backward, and central differences — and analyzes their accuracy as the step size h varies.
The script will:
Generate a noisy sine signal with additive Gaussian noise
Compute derivatives using forward, backward, and central schemes
Evaluate mean square errors against the analytical derivative
Plot log–log error curves for all methods
